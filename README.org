A large focus of this site is speed. It uses a blazingly fast actor system ([[https://actix.rs/][actix-web]]) for backend
and [[https://getbootstrap.com/][bootstrap]] for most of the frontend.

It also utilizes [[https://tera.netlify.com/][tera]] (a jinja2-like template engine), which allows for dynamic paging without having
to write too much JavaScript.

If you'd like to test it out for yourself, you'll need [[https://pandoc.org/installing.html][Pandoc]] installed on your system to convert
the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][org]] files to HTML. You could also just comment out the ~update_blog()~ line, since the converted
files are being tracked as well.
* Setup
