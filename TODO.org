* TODO Refactor template rendering
  Handle all render logic in one spot.
  Allow optional passing of context.
* TODO Implement user feedback w/ templates
  [[file:src/mail.rs:://%20TODO%20Make%20this%20more%20general,%20usable%20by%20all%20services.][Already hardcoded in contact form.]]
  Move inside future template rendering fn?
* TODO Remove index redirect to home
  Although inconsistency is bad, redirecting is worse.
  Either remove the ~/home~ portion altogther or modify history.
   #+begin_src js
   history.replaceState({}, 'home', '/home');
   #+end_src

   Using ~/~ as home will disrupt the page matching function. Use enum?
* TODO Add template for blog posts [0/5]
   - [ ] Timestamp last date modified or published.
   - [ ] Get title of post. Use file name?
   - [ ] Choose a theme for exporting.
   - [ ] Add logic for only exporting files that change.
     Might not be necessary, only happens once... Very fast.
* TODO Add server side image resizing
  Resizes image and caches it.
   - Max cache size in config file
   - Remove oldest first
* DONE Make tera instance global [[https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs][static]]                            :ARCHIVE:
